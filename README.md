The Game of Life is an example of a cellular automaton, a collection of colored cells on a
grid that evolve through a number of time steps according to a set of rules
defining the states of neighboring cells.


This simulation consists of the following components:
- A property defined in one- or two-dimensional space
- A mathematical rule to change this property for each step in the simulation 
- A way to display or capture the state of the system as it evolves
